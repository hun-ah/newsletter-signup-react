## How It's Made/Works:
**Built with: React and Vite**

This simple form was made with the intention of continuing to practice building with React and CSS.
Since having completed a few complex projects recently, I felt like it would be a good idea to build something simple, with a focus 
on clean and interactive UI, without worrying about more complex functionality.

The user can submit the form to sign-up for a newsletter and will be prompted if their email is invalid/not filled in. Upon successful
form submission, the user will be redirected to a success page and can navigate back to the inital screen upon click of a "dismiss message"
button. This form is fully responsive on dekstop and mobile.

My goals for this project were to practice structuring my code and files in a way that makes sense and to write clean/readable/DRY code. I 
have found that in my more complex projects the code often gets messy. It makes sense to start practicing file/code structure with a smaller
project and build up from there. I have traditionally jumped into larger projects, where the focus becomes overall functionality vs. 
adhering to clean code-writing practices.

## Lessons Learned/Takeaways:
- I'm currently enjoying using CSS modules to style my applications because of its modularity and abstraction from the rest of the code
- I've started to integrate OpenGraph metadata into my applications for better sharing experience across social platforms
- practice using RegEx for form/email validation
- CSS is still so hard! I'm still playing around with the best way to build out each page or component, with responsiveness in mind and to
address quirks I come across, (like properly applying a gradient hover effect to a button component)
